 Greetings,

 

The UNICEF Kosovo Office is conducting an evaluation of its work over the past five years.  As part of this evaluation, we would like to hear from Kosovo Youth who have applied for or participated in the UNICEF programmes of Upshift, Podium, and Ponder about changes in their lives since their participation.  This survey is designed to help improve the youth programming by gathering inputs from those who have been involved. 

 

As an applicant or participant in the youth activities, we would like to ask for your participation to fill out a short survey on how things have changed for you since the time you participated in the youth activities. The survey will be available for completion until Thursday, May 14th, 2020.

 

The survey should take about 20 minutes to complete. Your participation is voluntary, you can refuse to join, or you can stop after it has begun with no penalty.  Taking this survey (or not taking it) will not affect the benefits to yourself or your community from UNICEF. Your inputs will be anonymous and cannot be traced back to a specific person.

 

The Survey can be access through the following links (either in Albanian or in Serbian):
